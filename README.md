# POKI MANI

"Poki lipu ilo mani" would be an apt description of this app. That is, if you speak the "Language of Good", Toki Pona. The most literal translation to english would render something like *"Paper Basket \[of\] Machine Money."*

Or perhaps, "Envelopes for digital banking"

Poki Mani is an app that seeks to allow users to budget their online banking as if they were putting cash into envelopes. It promotes zero-based-budgetting, meaning every dollar, spent or saved, is accounted for in some enveloper or another. 

This app is currently a work in progress, but stayed tuned for further updates.
